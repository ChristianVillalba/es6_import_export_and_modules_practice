These items are the result of basic math operations of two numbers:
* Addition of 1 and 2
* Multiplication: 2 and 3
* Subtraction: 7 and 2 
* Division: 5 and 2

## What I have learned with this project: 
This app was helpful to get some practice about how import/export functionality and the concept of modules work.
